## Motivation

In the cargo deny [0.16.0](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0160---2024-08-02) the `allow-osi-fsf-free` attribute was removed from the `[licenses]` section, making mandatory to list all the allowed licenses in the `deny.toml` file. This project just make that listing in the toml part for you.
